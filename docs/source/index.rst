What is Coink?
--------------

Coink is an IoT piggy bank.

In the 21st Century piggy banks can be very easily connected to the cloud and
become part of the rapidly growing Internet of Things.

Having automatic reports of your savings online is not only very convenient but
can also make saving fun for kids! With Coink you can have real-time graphics
with your cumulative savings as well as the recent daily savings to track your
progress.

Adults may use it as well, not only for fun, but to help them quit smoking, for
example, keeping track of the money they save each day. Or in bars and
restaurants, to keep track of the tips they get each day.

Of course the magnetic coin detection system can be used elsewhere: in vending
machines, arcade game machines... The cloud-connected piggy bank is just an
application.
